          <a href='/about' class='p-link'>Civically</a> is where people help each other navigate law and government, launching late 2018.
          We're currently <a href='/start#story' class='p-link'>collecting stories</a>.

          We’re looking for stories about housing, traffic, employment, seniors, small businesses, consumer rights, migration and privacy.
          </div>

          What you've been through can help others going through the same thing.

          We're building a community knowledge base, where people are telling it how it is.

          title: "Your Story Matters"
          description: |
            Dealing with government or law can make us feel **angry, confused and powerless**.

            It can be frustratingly slow, and then many things can happen all at once. It can be hard to find people who make sense or understand what we're going through. It can feel like **the system is large, uncaring and out of our control**.

            ![not-alone](/plugins/civically-private/images/people/18.png) **You're not alone**. In fact, this is how most people feel about law and government. That's why we built Civically. It's a place that makes it all a bit clearer and easier, and puts you in control.

            We've built a lot of clever technology to do this, but to make Civically a reality **we need your help**. Your story, your experience with law and government in your own words, is the most important part of Civically.

            ![future](/plugins/civically-private/images/people/13.png) Your story can **help others understand** what is going on when the same thing happens to them. It can help others know what to do and what not to do. Sharing your story can also **help you understand** what has happened and what may happen in the future.

            That's why we want to hear your story. Before we launch Civically in late 2018 we are collecting stories from a variety of people. Those stories will help us create the **right kind of community** for Civically to work.

            People trust "people like them" more than they trust "institutions", "experts" or even "facts". People seek out the advice of other people, even if they have all the information they need already.

            Civically is an online community specifically built for people who need help with law and government. By fostering a community around civic issues, Civicially will be both a user-generated knowledge base and a clearing house for your organisation's work.

        healthy:
          title: In a healthy environment.
          description: |
            Online discussion can sometimes be unhealthy. Social platforms rely on user's data to drive profits and are often designed to polarise or for instant gratification.

            Civically is designed to produce constructive discussion and enagement. We don't, and never will, sell user's data. We really respect privacy and work hard to foster a healthy environment.

        help:
          title: Collaborate locally and globally.
          description: |
            People dealing with the law or government often need help from multiple sources. It's often hard for all stakeholders to coordinate effectively, or even know who else to talk to.

            Civically is built to make it easy for all local stakeholders to find and work with each other. Civically is also a global platform, where collaboration and knowledge-sharing can easily transcend borders.

        tech:
          title: On a platform built to scale.
            Community work is necessarily community-specific. Likewise, civic technology is often small-scale. This makes it hard for civic technology to scale like consumer technology does.

            Civically is built to work locally and scale globally. Our Civic App Store (the first of its kind) will have both local and general online community services in one place. Our App Store brings the advantages of scale and standardisation of a commercial app store to online civic services.

        non_profit:
          title: 100% free and non-profit.
          description: |
            Civically is not currently charging anything to anyone. We plan to launch a service-based business in 2020 to support our work. We may also introduce small fees in the Civic App Store. Any profits will be re-invested into Civically.

            During its development phase Civically has been operating as an Australian corporation. As we move closer to launch we are actively exploring non-profit structures in Australia and elsewhere.

        open_source:
          title: Open source and battle tested.
          description: |
            Civically was born out of work on open source forum software called [Discourse](meta.discourse.org). Many parts of Civically's functionality are already in use in thousands of online communities around the world.

            This means that even before we launch we know our features work and are user-friendly. It also means that by working with Civically you're also supporting the valuable work of many other community-minded organisations.
