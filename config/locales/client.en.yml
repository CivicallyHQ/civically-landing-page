              When you provide civic services, trying to keep up with the changing
              needs of your customers, government and society is tough. Juggling operations,
              budgets, staffing and technology at same time as staying relevant is a battle.

              The internet seems to promise a great way to engage with your stakeholders, but
              you find yourself in a fierce battle for attention. Knowing how and when to engage
              with your supporters and customers is a business itself.

              Civically is a platform where any civic service can connect to a local place. Members of
              the place have one place where they can find an array of services, and other people in their place.
              One place with multiple services has greater power online than multiple standalone services.

              On most platforms and search engines your visiblity is determined by how much money you have. You cannot buy
              visibility on Civically, it has to be earned by user reviews and independent assessments. If you're providing
              a valuable service to a place, we want you on our platform, regardless of how much money you have.

              When you add a service to Civically you're adding it to a platform. Each service starts as a single file of code to test the core idea.
              You don't need to build and maintain your own website to see whether it makes sense to make a service available online.
              Civically is built to work locally and scale globally, which means it is orders of magnitude cheaper than traditional online civic services.

              The core of Civically is a user to user platform where citizens can engage with other citizens and civic organizations.
              Relevant members of your staff can be identified and connected to where they are needed, a knowledge base about
              your service is developed and your services become more transparent.

              Providing good, efficient services to a diverse community is hard on any level of
              government. Public services are not the same as consumer services. They don't
              obey laws of supply and demand.

              In public service, one size does not fit all, standards matter and budgets are tight.
              Developing new online services or updates to existing services takes time and significant cost.
              When completed, any issues with the service reflect on the service provider, administratively and politically.

              Civically allows services to provide for local communities, while being part of global network.
              Each provider can tailor services to their needs of their constituents and also get the beneficial
              network effects of a bigger network.

              This makes Civically significantly cheaper than traditional online public services.
