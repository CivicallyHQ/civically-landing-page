          title: "Why Talk With Us"
          description: |
            Trying to solve a problem through lawyers or the government can make us feel **angry, confused and powerless**.

            ![not-alone](/plugins/civically-private/images/people/18.png) Lawyers can be expensive and intimidating. Government can be frustratingly slow and bureaucratic. It can be hard to find people who make sense or understand what you're going through. It can feel like **the system is large, uncaring and out of our control**.

            **You're not alone**. In fact, this is how most people feel. That's why we built Civically. It's a place that makes it all a bit clearer and easier, and puts you in control.

            ![future](/plugins/civically-private/images/people/13.png) We've built a lot of clever technology to do this, but to make Civically a reality **we need your help**. Talk to us about whats happened, talk to other folks dealing with similar problems and find useful services.

            Civically is running a trial of its platform in 2018. Before we launch in early 2019 we are giving early access to people who . Those stories will help us create the **right kind of community** for Civically to work.

        how:
          title: "How This Works"
          description: |
            This is a completely free service and we are not-for-profit. This is how "early access" works.

            ### Step 1
            **You contact us** through our [form](#access), **or we contact you** through a social worker or a friend.

            ### Step 2
            ![contact](/plugins/civically-private/images/people/14.png) **We'll talk** in person, on the phone or by email to find out a bit more about you and explain what we do.

            ### Step 3
            **We'll give you private access** to Civically to post, read other people's posts and figure out what to do next.

            ### Step 4
            ![launch](/plugins/civically-private/images/people/2.png) **Civically will become publicly available in early 2019**, allowing anyone to sign up and be part of our community.

        people:
          title: Find people who need help.
          description: |
            When dealing with law or government, most **people prefer the help of people like them** over that of an expert or authority ([World Justice Project Report](https://worldjusticeproject.org/sites/default/files/documents/WJP_Access-Justice_January_2018_LR_0.pdf)).

            Civically is a community built to connect people who need help with "people like them", while also giving them access to quality information and services. Our goal is to break down the barriers between people and 'the system'.

            By surfacing the informal "grey-area" of civic life, Civically can be an an **online clearing-house** for your organisation's work.

        healthy:
          title: In a healthy environment.
          description: |
            Social platforms typically rely on user's data to drive profits. They're designed to polarise, or for instant gratification. Deceptive or misleading information can spread easily.

            Civically uses both **human moderators and sophisticated technology** to foster constructive discussion that spreads accurate, useful information.

            We don't, and never will, sell user's data. We really **respect privacy and work hard to foster a healthy environment**.

        help:
          title: Collaborate locally and globally.
          description: |
            People dealing with the law or government often need help from multiple sources. It's often hard for **all stakeholders to coordinate effectively**, or even know who else to talk to.

            Civically is built to make it easy for all stakeholders to find and work with each other. Civically is also a global platform, where **collaboration and knowledge-sharing** can easily transcend borders.

        tech:
          title: On a platform built to scale.
            Community work is necessarily community-specific. Likewise, civic technology is often small-scale. This makes it **hard for civic technology to scale like consumer technology**.

            Civically is built to **work locally and scale globally**. Our Civic App Store (the first of its kind) will have both local and general online community services in one place. Our App Store brings the **advantages of scale and standardisation of a commercial app store to online civic services**.

        non_profit:
          title: 100% free and non-profit.
          description: |
            **Civically is completely free**. We plan to launch a service-based business in 2020 to support our work. Any profits will be re-invested into Civically in support of our mission.

            During its development phase Civically has been operating as an Australian corporation. As we move closer to launch we are actively exploring non-profit structures in Australia and elsewhere.

        open_source:
          title: Open source and battle-tested.
          description: |
            Civically was born out of work on an **industry-leading discussions software** platform ([Discourse](https://discourse.org)). Many parts of Civically's functionality are already in use in thousands of online communities around the world.

            This means that even before we launch **we know our features work and are user-friendly**. It also means that by working with Civically you're supporting the valuable work of many other community-minded organisations.
